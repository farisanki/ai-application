here is what i understood from the code we loaded the dataset from extreme benchmark focusing on the pan-x task
named entity recigbution is a nlp to identify entities like obj, location and organizations
NER categorizes and extracts the most important pieces of information from unstructured text without requiring time-consuming human analysis. It's particularly useful for quickly extracting key information from large amounts of data because it automates the extraction process.

BERT:is a bidirectional and is primarily designed for English, but it can be fine-tuned for other languages.
XLM-R: Designed to handle multiple languages. The "XLM" in its name stands for Cross-Lingual Model, indicating its focus on supporting various languages.
